This project exemplifies our 'buy to sell' strategy at its finest. We saw past the dated facade and recognized the incredible potential of this property's location. The transformation was total. We removed interior walls to create a breathtaking open-plan living space that flows seamlessly to an outdoor deck with ocean views.

Every detail, from the choice of paint colors to the hardware on the cabinets, was selected to appeal to the high-end coastal market. The result was a stunning, move-in-ready home that sold in a matter of days for well over the asking price.
