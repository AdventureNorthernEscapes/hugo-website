This project involved a meticulous restoration of a landmark Victorian property that had fallen into disrepair. Our primary goal was to honor the home's historic soul while infusing it with modern amenities expected by today's luxury market. We completely overhauled the foundation, replaced the slate roof, and restored the original gingerbread trim.

Inside, the layout was reconfigured to create an open-concept kitchen and living area, perfect for entertaining. High-end appliances, custom cabinetry, and designer lighting were installed throughout. The property now stands as a testament to how historic preservation and modern luxury can coexist beautifully.
